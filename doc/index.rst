Overview
--------

Libgoatvr is a simplified abstraction library for dealing with VR headsets. It
is designed to expose a single common API to access VR HMDs through any of the
supported backend modules, such as the Oculus SDK or OpenHMD, even allowing the
application to switch between them at runtime.

This documentation describes how to use libgoatvr in your programs, and is
split into the following sections:

 1. Initialization_
 2. `Head tracking`_
 3. Rendering_
 4. options and properties
 5. `Environment variables`_
