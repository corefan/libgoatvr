libgoatvr - a modular virtual reality abstraction library
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview

Libgoatvr is a simplified abstraction library for dealing with VR headsets. It
is designed to expose a single common API to access VR HMDs through any of the
supported backend modules, such as the Oculus SDK or OpenHMD, even allowing the
application to switch between them seamlessly at runtime.

Currently implemented VR modules:
 - Oculus SDK 0.4.1
 - OpenHMD (not done)
 - null

The null module can always be used as a fallback. It generates no input, and
presents only the left image of the stero pair to the display.

Code examples and detailed usage will be added at some point...
